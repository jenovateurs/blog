We are very happy to announce the release of Phalcon **v4.0.6**, a maintenance release. 

<!--more-->

[Github Tag](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/releases/tag/v4.0.6)

This release focused mostly on bug fixes reported by the community, as our testing suite and release tasks.

This will be the last version we release from the v4.0.x series. Our next version will be in the v4.1.x.

Finally, we worked a bit more on [v4.1](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/blob/4.1.x/CHANGELOG-4.1.md), adding more components as per our roadmap. The work was mostly focused on the Data Mapper implementation coming in later versions of v4. The bulk of the work being done in v4.1 comes from the [NFR list](https://docs.phalcon.io/4.0/en/new-feature-request-list) that the community has voted on.

Huge thanks to our contributors that reported issues, offered input as well as submitted pull requests with additions and corrections!
